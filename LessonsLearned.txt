01) X instance Y will compile if Y is interface in any case. If Y is class, it will compile only if X indirectly extends Y
02) Immutable pattern requires an final class
03) When using non-generic collections, iteration with an non-object index will cause an ClassCastException
04) Generic/Non-Generic variables can be mixed in the way A<T> a = new A(); T is then Object
05) A HashMap can be initialized with capacity in the constructor
06) Queue does not have remove(int), so Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>(); q.remove(1) will be autoboxed to remove(new Integer(1))
07) Variables and parameters in lambdas can shadow other local variables and produce compiler errors
08) Map.merge replaces nulls with the new value without applying the mapping function

22) There is a class java.io.PrintWriter but no java.io.PrintReader
23) High-level io streams are created based on other streams. FileReader, FileInputStream are low-level and OutputStream is neither.
